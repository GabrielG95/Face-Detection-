# Face-Detection-
Started practicing with openCV to be able to start using it Computer vision problems. 

This is my first time working with openCV. 
Made a little face detection program to detect faces in a youtube video.
I loaded in a face detection model from dlib along with facial landmarks to predict eyes, mouth, face, etc.
This program will draw a box around someones face along with dots around facial landmarks.

Next step is to train my own CNN for face detection and get it to work with this program.
